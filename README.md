# RapidASR: a new member of RapidAI family.

- Our vision is to offer an out-of-box engineering implementation for ASR.

- A cpp implementation of recognize-onnx.py in [Wenet-asr](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet) in which it implements the inference with ONNXRuntime. 

- For a version of pure CPP code, we need to do a bit of work to rewrite some components.

- Special thanks to its original author SlyneD.

- Less is more. Less dependency, more usability.

- Just offline mode, not support stream mode, aka separate files can be recognized.
- **QQ Group: 645751008**

## Supported modes:
- CTC_GREEDY_SEARCH
- CTC_RPEFIX_BEAM_SEARCH
- ATTENSION_RESCORING 

## Progress:
- [X] [Python](./python)
- [x] Linux
- [x] Mac
- [x] Android
- [ ] Windows

## Models

- The model is original from [wenetspeech/s0](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/tree/main/examples/wenetspeech/s0) and tested with `recognize-onnx.py`.
